# alntools

`alntools` represents read alignments to metagenomic assemblies and allows quick querying of specific intervals within contigs to fetch all reads or read summaries such as mutation pileups.

## Installation

### Dependencies

*   A modern C++ compiler (supporting C++17)
*   gnumake

Tested on macOS 13.3.1 and Ubuntu 20.04.

### Building

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eitanyaffe/alntools.git
    ```
2.  Compile the code:
    ```bash
    cd alntools
	make
    ```
    The executable will be located in `bin/macos/alntools` or `bin/linux/alntools`, depending on your system.
3.  (Optional) install the executable:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    This copies the executable to /usr/local/bin.
4.  (Optional) Run tests:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

## Input Format (PAF)

`alntools` processes alignment data in the Pairwise mApping Format (PAF). The following columns are required:

| Column Index | Description                                      | Type  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1            | Query sequence name                              | string|
| 2            | Query sequence length                            | int   |
| 3            | Query start (0-based)                            | int   |
| 4            | Query end (0-based)                              | int   |
| 5            | Relative strand ('+' or '-')                     | char  |
| 6            | Target sequence name (contig ID)                 | string|
| 7            | Target sequence length                           | int   |
| 8            | Target start on original strand (0-based)        | int   |
| 9            | Target end on original strand (0-based)          | int   |

Additionally, the **`cs:Z:` tag** (difference string) **must be present** in one of the optional fields (column 13 onwards). This tag encodes the base differences between the query (read) and the target (contig) and is essential for mutation analysis.

### Example PAF Line

```text
read_298    150 10  145 +   contig_12   5000    1500    1635    120 135 60  cs:Z::10*at:5+gg:20-c:15*cg:70
```

For a complete example of a PAF file, see `examples/align_100.paf` in the repository.

## Usage

### Constructing the Alignment Store (`.aln` file)

The `construct` command reads a PAF file and creates a binary `.aln` file, which stores the alignment data efficiently for later queries.

```bash
alntools construct -ifn_paf <input.paf> -ofn <output.aln> [options]
```

**Mandatory Arguments:**

*   `-ifn_paf <fn>`: Input alignment PAF file.
*   `-ofn <fn>`: Path for the output ALN file.

**Optional Arguments:**

An optional verification (of the cs strings) compares the assembly sequence after applying the cs string and the matching reads. This feature can verify the generation of valid cs strings by the mapper. For example, we tested in this manner over 1 million minimap2 alignments and all were correct.  

*   `-verify <T|F>`: Verify PAF alignments against sequence files (default: `false`).
*   `-ifn_reads <fn>`: Input read FASTQ file (required if `-verify T`).
*   `-ifn_contigs <fn>`: Input contig FASTA file (required if `-verify T`).
*   `-max_reads <int>`: Process only the first N alignments (0 means all, default: `0`).
*   `-quit_on_error <T|F>`: Exit immediately if an error is encountered during parsing or verification (default: `true`).
